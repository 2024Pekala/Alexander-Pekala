#### Hey Everyone, my name is Alexander Pekala; I am a freshman here at CNU. My pronouns are he/him. I decided to take this course because I enjoy learning about Digital Humanities. I first heard of DH when I was a junior in High School; I liked the concepts and thought it would be a great thing to minor in, especially as a business major. I like the idea of being about to work in media and public relations. I hope that taking this class will help me get more of an understanding of what DH has to offer and how I can work to become a better writer.
