I am a freshman here at CNU; My pronouns are he/him. I decided to take this course because I enjoy learning about Digital Humanities. I first heard of DH when I was a junior in High School; I liked the concepts and thought it would be a great thing to minor in, especially as a business major.
I like the idea of being about to work in media and public relations. I hope that taking this class will help me get more of an understanding of what DH has to offer and how I can work to become a better writer. 

I hope that after spending the next four years at **Christopher Newport University**. I accomplish my goals; I hope to graduate with a _Business Management_ degree specializing in Human Resources with minors in both _Digital Humanities_ and _Communication studies_. As for what I intend on doing following graduation, I’m at a crossroads; I’m unsure about whether I would go straight into a job or if I choose to continue my studies for either a master’s of HR or work towards my MBA. I am currently undergoing interviews with the IBM company in Raleigh, NC; If it goes smoothly, I will have a summer internship with the company under their HR department.

When it comes to academic success, there are quite a few that come to my mind. One that stands out is that I was the treasurer and vice president of the English National Honor Society my senior year of High school; I joined the society back in 2016.  I also took part in the GSA club throughout my high school years. While both of these were great throughout my High school career, I look forward to joining various clubs during my time at CNU. While I’m unsure about what clubs I’ll be partaking in, I am ready to continue my education and have some fun in college.

In the photo above you see my dog Tyson; he is a Pekinese mix that we rescued back in 2015. As you can see, he looks like a gremlin, its a running joke in my family that we shouldn’t feed him after midnight because of the movie _Gremlins_. When I’m not at school, I am back home in Pennington, NJ, roughly 10 minutes from downtown Princeton. I originally grew up in Leesburg, VA but moved to New Jersey weeks before coming down to CNU. I am one of three kids in my family; I have an older brother and a twin sister. While I’m here at CNU, my sister Jessie is at WVU for Nursing. My older brother Paul recently graduated from Virginia Tech and now works for Ford in Detroit, Michigan. My mother is a real estate agent, and my father works as the General Manager IT Operational Excellence at ETS.
