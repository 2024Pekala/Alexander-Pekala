**Summary:** _Mapping the Gay Guides_ is a Digital Humanities project which displays the findings of different locations that housed safety for the LGBTQ community in the early 1960s. The website follows _Bob Damron’s_ books, a gay man who frequently traveled around the united states. Damron wrote these travel guides for the LGBTQ community to follow to find safe locations to gather, such as hotels, bars/clubs, and more. The project was directed underneath project directors Dr. Amanda Regan and Dr. Eric Gonzaba. 

The site allows for its users to navigate throughout the refinement found and mapped for queer communities.  The technology used in this project includes geocoding, leaflet, and open street map. Geocoding is where an address is converted into spatial data and then returned as coordinates. Leaflet is used for the interactive UI.


**Findings:** _Mapping the Gay Guides_ does a great job at integrating Damron’s address books and technology use. As stated in the Summary, the website uses Vignettes as visual guides to establish specific events regarding the history of the LGBTQ community in the United States throughout a period. Using the vignettes allows for the user to get to a particular event in the database. One main feature of navigating the website is by using Vignettes. Vignettes are smaller events or case studies that happen to be based on the usage of visualizations. The website is always updating, and the authors hope to release more information from guides to include 1960-present times. With this information, I believe that a great addition to the website would be by adding the vignettes to pop up on the map. 




The creators of the website made it pretty easy to navigate. The layout of the site is well throughout and put together. The directors made it so that it is straightforward to navigate and get from one page to the next. There are seven main pages that you can navigate to these are Home, Map, Vignettes, Methodology, Ethics, News, Twitter, and a link to their GitHub. I’ve found that navigating around the website is simple. _Mapping the Gay Guides_ is a digital humanities project because it shows the development of the LGBTQ community, culture, and experiences throughout history. I believe that this is a smart decision to incorporate from Bob Damron’s Address books’ findings. This allows people to see how extensive Bob Damron’s Address books and how they gave the LGBTQ community archive of locations that were LGBTQ friendly.  


Using the map features is easy; the directors set up the map to feature a drop-down menu for the location, amenity feature, type of place, and year. The plan currently holds between 785 entries starting in 1964 and wapping 4461 entries in 1980. The website designers incorporated such detail into every event that was listed in Damron’s address books. Each listing has a title, the year, the street address, what city, what state, which amenity feature, the type of location such as bar, hotel, club, etc., and whether or not the area is verified by google. 
 
 
 
 I have found that the website is not as mobile-friendly as it is with desktop users. The interface on a mobile browser tends to run smaller. Not all the words fit within screen limits; this allows a user to have a tough time working with the map. 
 
 

While the website’s map shows each location on the map, whether it is a bar/club, hotel, local hangout, etc., it continues to grow each year as new publications of Damron's Guidebooks are incorporated. While it shows a pinpoint on the map, the project should one day contain symbols that help identify locations more specifically rather than just a dot on a map.





Overall, the project is exceptionally put together; I like the website’s overall layout, and the project is very user-friendly. All-in-all the project does a fantastic job of showing the struggles and development of the LGBTQ community throughout history.
