**Summary:** _Mapping the Gay Guides_ is a Digital Humanities project which displays the findings of different locations that housed safety for the LGBTQ community in the early 1960s. The website follows _Bob Damron’s_ books, a gay man who frequently traveled around the united states. Damron wrote these travel guides for the LGBTQ community to follow to find safe locations to gather, such as hotels, bars/clubs, and more. The project was directed underneath project directors Dr. Amanda Regan and Dr. Eric Gonzaba. 

The site allows for its users to navigate throughout the refinement found and mapped for queer communities.  The technology used in this project includes geocoding, leaflet, and open street map. Geocoding is where an address is converted into spatial data and then returned as coordinates. Leaflet is used for the interactive UI.


**Findings:** _Mapping the Gay Guides_ does a great job at integrating Damron’s address books and technology use. As stated in the Summary, the website uses Vignettes as visual guides to establish specific events regarding the history of the LGBTQ community in the United States throughout a period. Using the vignettes allows for the user to get to a particular event in the database. One main feature of navigating the website is by using Vignettes. Vignettes are smaller events or case studies that happen to be based on the usage of visualizations. The website is always updating, and the authors hope to release more information from guides to include 1960-present times. With this information, I believe that a great addition to the website would be by adding the vignettes to pop up on the map. 




The creators of the website made it pretty easy to navigate. The layout of the site is well throughout and put together. The directors made it so that it is straightforward to navigate and get from one page to the next. There are seven main pages that you can navigate to these are Home, Map, Vignettes, Methodology, Ethics, News, Twitter, and a link to their GitHub. I’ve found that navigating around the website is simple. _Mapping the Gay Guides_ is a digital humanities project because it shows the development of the LGBTQ community, culture, and experiences throughout history. I believe that this is a smart decision to incorporate from Bob Damron’s Address books’ findings. This allows people to see how extensive Bob Damron’s Address books and how they gave the LGBTQ community archive of locations that were LGBTQ friendly.
