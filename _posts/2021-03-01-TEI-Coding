### _TEI Coding_


This assignment's Purpose was  to code four pages from “The Yellow Wall-Paper” by Charlotte Perkins Stetson using the Text Encoding Initiative, also known as TEI.
I was assigned pages 4,5,6 and 7. We had to use this program called Oxygen to code using TEI. 
The program looked difficult based on first glance, but it was easier than I expected once I got into the groove of things. 

Before we even started with coding, we were tasked to mark up each of our pages, making it easier to code since we’d know what to do with each paragraph.
We had to use <pb, <p></p>, <hi, and more to code each section of the book.
For me, it took quite a while to mark up all of my work. I personally liked the typed-up pages that our professor gave us, or else I’d probably still be trying to figure out what the manuscript says.
