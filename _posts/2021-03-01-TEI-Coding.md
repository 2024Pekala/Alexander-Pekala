### _TEI Coding Reflection_



This assignment’s purpose was to code four pages from “The Yellow Wall-Paper” by Charlotte Perkins Stetson using the Text Encoding Initiative, also known as TEI. I was assigned pages 4,5,6 and 7. We had to use this program called Oxygen to code using TEI. The program looked difficult based on first glance, but it was easier than I expected once I got into the groove of things.

Before we even started with coding, we were tasked to mark up each of our pages, making it easier to code since we’d know what to do with each paragraph. We had to use **<pb, <p </p, <hi,** and more to code each section of the book. For me, it took quite a while to mark up all of my work. I personally liked the typed-up pages that our professor gave us, or else I’d probably still be trying to figure out what the manuscript says.

Personally, I found that using Oxygen and TEI, in general, to be a tad difficult. The first time I attempted to use the program, it kept erasing the previous line that I had written. Therefore, I took a break and collected myself because I was getting rather irritated, but I tried again later and found it easier. I learned that I had to be patient when using the program, or else I wouldn’t get much of the work done. Once I got into a good groove, I found it actually quite easy to finish coding the pages.

I tried to follow along when my professor explained how TEI works and how to navigate Oxygen, although I found it quite difficult to do both at the same time. I was so happy to see that she recorded that lecture. Therefore, I could go back and forth with the recording to help familiarize myself with the program. I made sure to save my work frequently to ensure that I will not lose all my code. Overall my experience with TEI was interesting, and I am proud to have been able to code without having any prior experience.
