  ### Introduction 

My project proposal is mapping and ranking the colleges and universities in the state of Virginia. My project aims to map and rank Virginia universities in comparison to each other to help rising juniors and seniors in high school find an affordable college that best fits the student’s occupational interest and major, and atmosphere. I wanted to pick this project because it would be an incredible resource for those who don’t know what schools they are applying to. When I was a junior in college, I wish I had help available to me because I was all over the place and didn’t have a set plan. 


After seeing how my high school friends stress out over which colleges to apply for and what makes each one unique, I thought about this. I knew that I could do a mapping project, I thought initially about mapping universities around the US, but after meeting with Dr. Stover, we both agreed that it would be too broad and narrow down the area. Therefore I picked just universities in VA. Ideally, my project could be used to be a guide to high school students or transfer students. I have carefully constructed data and formed pods containing ten universities each and comparing/contrasting vital points in the overall ranking of colleges.

### Start of Project

I had no idea where to start when it came to the Environmental scan. I remember looking over so many articles regarding colleges, but it was difficult to find scholarly articles that contained information about ranking. I found articles that expand on topics of Higher ranks that would attract more elite students, funds, and support. Overall It was pretty challenging to find articles and other projects that are similar to my project.

I was excited and ready to put this project together, I loved the thought of having a mapping project, and I get to use my knowledge and background of GIS to use. I was thrilled to expand my knowledge, and what better than mapping, which gives an interactive style and feels compared to just an article or blog.
