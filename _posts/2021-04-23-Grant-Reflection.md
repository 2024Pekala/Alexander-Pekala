  ### Introduction 

My project proposal is mapping and ranking the colleges and universities in the state of Virginia. My project aims to map and rank Virginia universities in comparison to each other to help rising juniors and seniors in high school find an affordable college that best fits the student’s occupational interest and major, and atmosphere. I wanted to pick this project because it would be an incredible resource for those who don’t know what schools they are applying to. When I was a junior in college, I wish I had help available to me because I was all over the place and didn’t have a set plan.
