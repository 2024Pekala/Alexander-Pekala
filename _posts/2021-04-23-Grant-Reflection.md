# Grant Process and Reflection Blog

  ### Introduction 

My project proposal is mapping and ranking the colleges and universities in the state of Virginia. My project aims to map and rank Virginia universities in comparison to each other to help rising juniors and seniors in high school find an affordable college that best fits the student’s occupational interest and major, and atmosphere. I wanted to pick this project because it would be an incredible resource for those who don’t know what schools they are applying to. When I was a junior in college, I wish I had help available to me because I was all over the place and didn’t have a set plan. 


After seeing how my high school friends stress out over which colleges to apply for and what makes each one unique, I thought about this. I knew that I could do a mapping project, I thought initially about mapping universities around the US, but after meeting with Dr. Stover, we both agreed that it would be too broad and narrow down the area. Therefore I picked just universities in VA. Ideally, my project could be used to be a guide to high school students or transfer students. I have carefully constructed data and formed pods containing ten universities each and comparing/contrasting vital points in the overall ranking of colleges.

### Start of Project

I had no idea where to start when it came to the Environmental scan. I remember looking over so many articles regarding colleges, but it was difficult to find scholarly articles that contained information about ranking. I found articles that expand on topics of Higher ranks that would attract more elite students, funds, and support. Overall It was pretty challenging to find articles and other projects that are similar to my project.

I was excited and ready to put this project together, I loved the thought of having a mapping project, and I get to use my knowledge and background of GIS to use. I was thrilled to expand my knowledge, and what better than mapping, which gives an interactive style and feels compared to just an article or blog. 

### Reflection

Opposite to the Environmental scan, I felt great about writing my grant narrative because it had to do with my project and not what articles, scholarships, and other projects are about. I could write about my ideas and what technology and programs I would use to run smoothly.

For the Grant process, I have looked at the outlines and reviewed each section accordingly. I felt pretty good after going over the peer review outline and comparing it to my work. While it’s not a different pair of eyes, I could see it from a different perspective, and I can edit and change it to fit the descriptions better. I feel as my writing can always be improved. I continue to revise and edit my paper to make it the best it can be.

In class as a whole, I thoroughly enjoyed having the opportunity to peer review my classmates and get feedback on my writing. I believe that peer reviews in this class are highly beneficial for me to get a different pair of eyes who have a different perspective.


### Challenges and Setbacks

I started on quite the bumpy road when it came to the Grant writing process. I, unfortunately, was not able to participate in the peer reviews due to computer issues and had to ship my computer away to get fixed at the same time. However,  lost my entire paper or everything I had gotten done, such as my Environmental Scan and my Grant Narrative, because they ended up wiping my hard drive. Putting me at a bit of a disadvantage because I had to buy a new computer.



I sadly had to restart my Grant as a whole which was somewhat a struggle; I knew what to write about, but I lost all the sources I had, so it took a long time to figure out where and what sources I had used before the incident. 


### Overall Class


I liked how we had to post on Twitter for class, I never had a professor or teacher that has done that, and I find it interesting, and I like how I can see or reply to my classmates. I learned a lot about what it takes behind the scenes with the TEI and grant project. It gave me a better insight into how much work goes into the project and not as simple as I had initially thought. 
Overall I was thrilled to take this course because I loved the thought of being a Digital Humanities minor after learning about it in high school. I feel as I have improved as a writer, and I can’t wait to take another class with Dr. Stover next semester and learn even more about Digital Humanities.
